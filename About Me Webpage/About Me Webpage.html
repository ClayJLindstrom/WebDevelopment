Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Clay Lindstrom
Submitted: 8/31/22
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I was able to complete the project, but the organization of the code seemed frustrating to me.
perhaps it was because of all of my pseudo code, but when coding the table, the code felt like
too much effort for too little detail. It was a pain.
	You were right when you said that this project had a lot of "little parts" to it, professor. The little parts 
almost drove me crazy. I'm glad the assignment is over, though.

	<p><b>Drawing and Animation: </b>Though I don't want to have a career in animation, I still have a great love for drawing. I made my own art for my games for a while (and they're pretty good, if I can say so myself). I also have a lot of respect for people who work on such art projects.</p>
	<p><b>The Temple: </b>I'm pretty active in my church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and I love it. Though my favorite place in the church is the Temple, such as the Mt. Timpanogos Utah Temple. There's a feeling of peace there that one doesn't feel anywhere else.</p>


<!--For the Class Schedule I want you to create a table that shows your weekly class schedule. This is easy to do using table elements, but it does require some attention to detail. 

Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”.-->
	<h2>Class Schedule</h2>
	<!--Create a table with 6 columns.
	Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell. Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.-->
	<table border="1", cellspacing="3", cellpadding="3" style="table-layout:fixed; width:100%;">
<!--The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).-->
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Monday</td>
			<td>Tuesday</td>
			<td>Wednesday</td>
			<td>Thursday</td>
			<td>Friday</td>
		</tr>
<!--Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments. You can start as early as you feel necessary.
List the classes you have as cells. Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item.  If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess.  I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.
Fill up your schedule. Make stuff up if you have to.  I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday.  In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.
Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them.
(2 points) on your weekly schedule, can you fill in in each block so that each thing is color-coded in its own color (English is yellow, calculus is light red, work is light blue, etc)?
(2 points) equal column widths. On your schedule, can you find a way to have the column widths fixed so that they’re all the same size-->
